This was the final project from NE111 (Fall 2025 of the 1A term). Programming Fundamentals for Nanotechnology Engineering.

The task:
 - Allow users to enter data either manually or by uploading a CSV file. 
 - Be able to fit multiple different types of distributions to a histogram created from the data.
 - This app specifically allows: ['Beta', 'Chi-squared', 'Gamma', 'Gumbel', 'Lognormal', 'Logistic', 'Normal', 'Rayleigh', 'Student’s t', 'Uniform', 'Weibull']
 - Allow for users to manually adjust the fit using sliders to adjust different parameters
 - Be visually appealing, or at least have a clean and organized layout
